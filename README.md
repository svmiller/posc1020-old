POSC 1020
=========

This repository contains my course notes and other supporting material for [POSC 1020](http://svmiller.github.io/teaching/posc-1020-introduction-to-international-relations/), an introductory-level class on international relations I teach at Clemson University.

The contents of this directory can be considered "volatile". I may pull an entire directory (or the whole thing) at my discretion (e.g. when the class starts anew another semester).
