# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Discuss the rationality of terrorism.*

### Is Terrorism Rational?

### A Definition of Terrorism

We define **terrorism** as:

- premeditated use of violence by individuals or subnational groups to...
- intimidiate a "larger audience" beyond the immediate victims to...
- obtain some objective that is political or social in nature.

Terrorism scholars split hairs further about the perpetrator and immediate victim.

- However, the "larger audience" is the same.

# Beliefs about Terrorism
### Aren't Terrorists "Crazy"

Common belief about terrorists: they're crazy radicals.

- Terrorists prefer terrorism because they are cruel.
- Therefore: governments should never negotiate with terrorists.

However, terrorists vary by type.

- Declarations of no-negotiation actually precipitates some terrorist acts.


### Types of Terrorists

![Types of Terrorists and Governments](table7-1.jpg)

## When a Reluctant Terrorist Goes with Terror
### When a Reluctant Terrorist Goes with Terror

Assume for a reluctant terrorist:

- *U*(negotiations) = 1
- *U*(terrorism) = .4
- *U*(government repression) = 0

The reluctant terrorist does *not* know the government type. Assume:

- *p*(responsive) = .5
- *p*(repressive) = .5

What's the expected utility for the "terrorist" to negotiate?

### When a Reluctant Terrorist Goes with Terror

\begin{eqnarray}
EU_{negotiations}  &=& p*U_{(negotiations)} + (1 - p)*U_{(repression)}    \nonumber \\
EU_{negotiations} &=& (.50)(1) + (.50)(0) \nonumber \\
EU_{negotiations} &=& .5 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Where $EU_{terrorism}$ = .4, the reluctant terrorist prefers to negotiate.

### When a Reluctant Terrorist Goes with Terror

Assume *p*(repressive) = .65. Then:

\begin{eqnarray}
EU_{negotiations}  &=& p*U_{(negotiations)} + (1 - p)*U_{(repression)}    \nonumber \\
EU_{negotiations} &=& (.35)(1) + (.65)(0) \nonumber \\
EU_{negotiations} &=& .35 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Under these conditions, reluctant terrorists commit terror acts despite a preference for negotiation.

### When a Reluctant Terrorist Goes with Terror

When a government declares that it will not negotiate with terrorists, reluctant terrorists believe the probability that the government is repressive increases.

- The more credible the government statement is in the eyes of reluctant terrorists, the more strongly they will believe that the government is repressive.

## What Do No-Negotiation Declarations Mean for Terrorist Beliefs?
### What Do No-Negotiation Declarations Mean for Terrorist Beliefs?

We can use the Bayesâ€™s rule to see how reluctant terrorists incorporate new information and update their beliefs about the type of government they face based on what the government says or does.

### Bayes Rule


With only two possible outcomes (*B* and ~*B*).

$$
	p(B \thinspace  | \thinspace  A) = \frac{p(A \thinspace | \thinspace B)p(B)}{p(A \thinspace  | \thinspace B)p(B) + p(A \thinspace |\sim B)p(\sim B)}
$$

### A Reworked Theorem

Let:

- *S* = statement against negotiation
- *R* = government is repressive type
- *~R* = government is not repressive type (i.e. is responsive)

Then:

$$
	p(R \thinspace  | \thinspace  S) = \frac{p(S \thinspace | \thinspace R)p(R)}{p(S \thinspace  | \thinspace R)p(R) + p(S \thinspace |\sim R)p(\sim R)}
$$


### A Reworked Theorem

Assume:

- *p*(S | R) = 1
- *P*(S | ~ R) = .5
- *p*(R) = .5

Then: 

\begin{eqnarray}
p(R \thinspace  | \thinspace  S)  &=& \frac{p(S \thinspace | \thinspace R)p(R)}{p(S \thinspace  | \thinspace R)p(R) + p(S \thinspace |\sim R)p(\sim R)}   \nonumber \\
p(R \thinspace  | \thinspace  S) &=& \frac{(1)(.50)}{(1)(.50) + (.50)(.50)} \nonumber \\
p(R \thinspace  | \thinspace  S) &=& \frac{.5}{.75} \nonumber \\
p(R \thinspace  | \thinspace  S) &=& .67 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

### Implications of Bayes Theorem

Statements of no-negotiation *increase* the reluctant terrorist's probability (i.e. **posterior probability**) that the government is repressive.

- In our example, reluctant terrorists negotiate when *p* = .50.
- A statement of no-negotiation makes terrorism a more attractive strategy.

### General Implications

We observe a reinforced cycle of beliefs.

- The more reluctant terrorists believe the government is repressive, the more likely they conduct terrorist acts.
- The more terrorist acts, the more likely the government believes the reluctant terrorist is a true believer.

*Perceptions matter.*

- The choices they make are rational, but ex post suboptimal.

# Credible Commitments, Strategic Dilemmas, and Terrorism
## A Three-Player Terrorism Game
### Credible Commitments, Strategic Dilemmas, and Terrorism

Assume a simple game with three players.

- The government (*G*)
- A moderate terrorist group 
- A hard-line terrorist group

Students may balk at the idea of a "moderate" terrorist group, but that would belie observations across the world and what we've said to this point in the lecture.

### Preference Orderings

The government prefers all-out victory (*W*) to conceding to moderates' demands (*M*).

- It also prefers *M* to a victory by hard-line terrorists (*H*)
- As such: *W* > *M* > *H*

Terrorist preference orderings:

- Moderates: *M* > *H* > *W*
- Hard-liners: *H* > *M* > *W*

Let *X* be thee utility of the status quo, which we assume is a backdrop of terror.


### More Assumptions

If *G* offers a deal to the moderates that is rejected:

- *G* gets a payout equal to *X* + *c*
- Both terror groups get *X* - *c*
- i.e. terrorists pay a political price for rejecting negotiations.

If *G* and the moderates agree to a deal:

- *G* promises concessions worth *k* to the moderates.
- Moderates agree to disarm and provide counterterror assistance against the hard-liners.

### More Assumptions

With counterterrorism, the probability that *G* defeats hard-liners = *p*.

- Without it, *p*(*G* defeats hard-liners) = *r*
- Note: *p* > *r*.

### A Representation of the Game

![A Representation of the Terrorism Game](figure7-1.jpg)

### Preference Orderings for this Game

- For *G*: *W* > *X* + *c* > *X* > *M* > *H*
- For moderates: *M* > *H* > *X* > *X* - *c* > *W*
- For hard-liners: *H* > *M* > *X* > *X* - *c* > *W*

## When Do Governments and Moderate Terrorists Negotiate?
### Counterterrorism and Optimal Concessions

Assume: 

- *G* and moderates agree to a deal.
- Hard-liners reject the deal.
- *G* implements concessions worth *k*.
- Moderates end game with decision to provide (or not) counterterror assistance.

Moderates provide counterterror assistance if:

- *p*(*k*) + (1 - *p*)(*H*) > *r*(*k*) + (1 - *r*)*H*


### Counterterrorism and Optimal Concessions

Let's rearrange this:

\begin{eqnarray}
p(k) + (1 - p)(H)  &>&  r(k) + (1 - r)H   \nonumber \\
pk + H - pH &>& rk + H - rH \nonumber \\
pk - rk &>& H - H + pH - rH \nonumber \\
k(p - r) &>& H(p - r) \nonumber \\
k &>& H \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

In plain English, what does this say?

### Counterterrorism and Optimal Concessions

However, *G* makes a prior decision to implement or renege.

- *U*(implement) = *p*(*k*) + (1 - *p*)(*H*)
- *U*(renege) = *r*(*W*) + (1 - *r*)(*H*)
- Recall: *p* > *r* and *W* > (1 - *k*).

*G* faces a trade-off:

- better odds of winning but for a smaller gain, or:
- worse odds of winning for a bigger gain.

### Counterterrorism and Optimal Concessions

Let's isolate for *k* again. *G* implements when:

\begin{eqnarray}
p(1 - k) + (1 - p)(H)  &\ge&  r(W) + (1 - r)(H)  \nonumber \\
p - pk + H - pH &\ge& rW + H - rH \nonumber \\
p - pH + rH - rW &\ge& pk\nonumber \\
p(1 - H) + r(H - W) &\ge& pk \nonumber \\
(1 - H) + \frac{r(H - W)}{p} &\ge& k \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}


### Counterterrorism and Optimal Concessions

However, we don't expect moderates to accept a deal unless *G* implements it. Let's solve for *k* again.

\begin{eqnarray}
X - c  &\le&  p(k) + (1 - p)(H) \nonumber \\
X - c - (1 - p)(H) &\le& pk \nonumber \\
\frac{X - c - (1 - p)(H)}{p} &\le& k \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

A deal exists when: 

$$
(1 - H) + \frac{r(H - W)}{p} \ge k \ge \frac{X - c - (1 - p)(H)}{p}
$$

## Concessions and Terrorist Violence
### Concessions and Terrorist Violence

A concession exists in which *G* and the moderates agree to a deal, but *H* rejects.

- The concessions *k* results in counterterror help against the hard-liners.

However, does this guarantee a decrease in violence?

### Concessions and Terrorist Violence

*G*'s access to resources increases, but so does *H*'s access to resources.

- Moderates are likely to lose members whose ideal positions are closer to *H* than *k*.
- But, they otherwise preferred *M* to *H*.

*G* improves in its ability to defeat *H*, but *H* gains more support.

- Thus, *H* is more likely to engage in more terrorism.

# Conclusion and Implications
### Conclusion and Implications

Important conclusions about defeating terrorism:

1. Governments have little incentive to implement promises if there's just one terror group.
2. It's not possible to reach a deal with all terrorists.
3. Wiping out terrorism routinely requires support of moderate terror groups.
4. Unless all members of a moderate group are on board with government concessions, hard-line terrorists will see an increase in capabilities.

### Other Implications

There are some other intriguing implications too.

1. Moderate terrorists have an incentive to foster extremists.
2. High-quality counterterrorism increases the probability of all-out victory, but makes it more difficult to negotiate.
3. Moderate terrorists with poor counterterror abilities are unattractive partners.
